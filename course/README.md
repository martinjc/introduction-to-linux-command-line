# Introduction to the Linux Command Line

The purpose of this introduction is to introduce you to using the Linux/Unix Command Line, or 'shell'. The Unix shell has been around longer than most of its users have been alive.

It has survived so long because it's a power tool that allows people to do complex things with just a few keystrokes.
More importantly, it helps them combine existing programs in new ways and automate repetitive tasks so they aren't typing the same things over and over again.

Use of the shell is fundamental to using a wide range of other powerful tools. This lesson will start you on a path towards using these resources effectively.
